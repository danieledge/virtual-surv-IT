"""Decision engine for `virt-surv go` - NOT a Claude Code hook, not run by the model,
never invoked from inside a session. This runs BEFORE Claude Code even starts, from the
user's own shell (the "go" branch of virt-surv's own shell function, written by
install_helper.py's run_setup_alias - a separate `virt-team` alias existed for one turn
of this same feature and was explicitly rejected as confusing: one alias, not two).

Two things get moved entirely outside the LLM pipeline here, for two different reasons:

1. **Tool-inventory pre-warming.** `check-review-tools.sh`'s own 7-day-TTL cache means a
   warm read never spawns a shell (`engage_probe.py`'s `_read_cached_tool_probe`) - the
   remaining cost only shows up on a cold/stale cache, and even then it's a one-time,
   machine-level fact, not a per-engagement one. Refreshing it here (best-effort, via the
   exact same `run_tool_probe` the live probe already calls - no logic duplicated) means
   that rare cost never touches a model turn at all.
2. **The resume-vs-new decision.** Live-observed unreliability, not just latency: the
   model-driven menu (`AskUserQuestion` over `engagement_state.resume_menu()`'s output)
   has occasionally picked the wrong option before self-correcting. This computes the
   SAME menu with the SAME function, but the human picks directly in the terminal - no
   model reasoning involved in the choice itself.

**Output contract (load-bearing - the caller is a shell function capturing stdout via
command substitution):** ALL interactive text (the menu, the prompt) goes to **stderr**.
**stdout carries ONLY the final decision**, one line, one of:
  - `--resume <slug>` - resume that open engagement
  - `--new` - start new work
  - `` (empty) - nothing to decide, or the human chose to decide inside the session
Never both an interactive transcript and the decision on the same stream - a caller doing
`decision="$(virt_team_launcher.py)"` must get exactly the flag string, nothing else.

Never asks about execution consent or any other safety gate - deliberately out of scope.
That gate requires the human to see what's actually being asked BEFORE granting it
(ADR-002: "intent, not grant"); asking it here, before the human has even described the
task, would be a blanket sight-unseen yes, not the specific informed consent the design
requires. Moving THAT decision out would weaken the protection, not just relocate it.

Fails open on any error: prints nothing to stdout (empty decision), so the caller always
falls back to a plain `claude` launch with no pre-seeded prompt - this script existing or
working correctly is never load-bearing for actually starting a session.
