# House rules - the team's general, cross-project conventions

The durable **engineering, review, process and safety** conventions the team follows on **every**
engagement. This file ships with the plugin and is **general by design**.

> **This is NOT a project memory.** The plugin is typically installed user-wide and used across
> many independent projects, so it must hold **no project-specific knowledge**. Anything specific
> to a given engagement - a typology nuance, a threshold rationale, a false-positive driver, a venue quirk, a
> calibration choice - lives in **that project's own memory** (its `CLAUDE.md`), **not here**
> (CLAUDE.md §6). Keep this file to patterns that hold regardless of the project. Advisory agents
> *recommend* additions; the PM commits them.

## Engineering & review patterns
- **A *necessary* condition is an early-continue, not a weighted score.** When a condition must
  hold (e.g. a price/threshold gate), implement it as a hard gate that terminates evaluation - never
  a score that a strong signal elsewhere can compensate for. That compensation is a common
  false-positive source and a frequent audit finding.
- **Carry the obligation + the keystone linkage as alert *fields*, not just free-text.** The alert
  record *alone* must satisfy the alert→logic→obligation trace - that's the one place an investigator
  and a regulator actually look. Don't bury it in a `reason` string.
- **Never let an unresolved mapping masquerade as finalised.** If a regulatory mapping or scope is
  still an open decision, carry an explicit status (e.g. `PROVISIONAL`) or reference it via an
  RTM/decision-log id - don't embed a lone citation literal that *looks* final.
- **Extraction/conversion code must prove completeness mechanically.** Any code that extracts or
  converts data (Excel/CSV/exports → analysis input) ships with a **source-vs-output
  reconciliation** - record counts plus a control total on a value column - built into the
  deliverable and asserted by its tests; it fails loudly, never `except`-and-continue over rows,
  never silent value coercion/truncation. Onward analysis states its reconciliation basis (📊).
  Why: extraction fails *silently* - a truncated extract looks complete and contaminates every
  downstream number until someone reconciles it, sometimes years later. House implementations of
  the pattern: `scripts/convert_file.py` (below), `scripts/ingest.py` (skip-tracking + loud
  warning) and `scripts/validate_masking.py::detection_fidelity` (count + shape tie-out).
- **File conversion goes through the front door - never hand-parse.** Any Excel / CSV / PDF /
  Word input an agent needs as data or text is read via
  `python -m scripts.convert_file <file> [--schema <feed>.yaml]` - not ad-hoc pandas/openpyxl
  one-offs, not a quick `csv.reader`, not "I'll just export it". The converter is lossless by
  default (zero type inference - the float-mangled account ID and the guessed date format are
  the two classic silent corrupters), validates against a per-feed schema when given one
  (`config/feed-schema-example.yaml`), applies the reconciliation rule above mechanically
  (ragged rows, truncation signs, row counts, control totals), and **emits a JSON evidence
  report every run** - attach that report (or its summary) to the deliverable; a conversion
  without its report is not evidence (📊). Its dependencies are vendored in `vendor/`, so it
  works from a bare `git clone` with no pip access. PDFs are text extraction only - table
  structure in a PDF is layout, not data; get the upstream Excel/CSV instead.

## Reporting & audit conventions
- **Disposition every open question before sign-off (don't let them dangle).** When a spec/BRD/review
  raises open questions for a downstream owner, the owner must **formally disposition each one**
  (✅ answered / ⏭️ needs deployment input / 🔴 open-decision-required) in a tracked decision log, and
  the Definition of Done checks it. A question *partly touched in passing* is **not** dispositioned.
- **Two-snapshot reporting (as-found vs as-delivered) - don't retro-edit evidence.** When a
  fix→re-review loop resolves findings, **preserve the as-found record** (the QA handover / review
  report - the audit trail of *what was caught*) and record the **resolved** state in the delivery
  report's disposition. Never rewrite the source evidence to "look passed". (Codified in
  `docs/templates/qa-handover.md` + `docs/templates/delivery-report.md`.)
- **Two kinds of "open" - keep them distinct.** 🔴 *unresolved defects* (a real problem; the verdict
  cannot be ✅) vs ⏭️ *deferred deploy-gates* (calibrate on real data, scale-test, human sign-off)
  that are **correctly** open and out of scope for the current stage. A report that shows
  deploy-gates as open is *good*; one that hides them to look "all green" is the failure. The verdict
  must match the disposition.

## Execution safety
- **Hooks are declared in TWO files by design - keep them in sync.** The PreToolUse guards live in
  both `hooks/hooks.json` (plugin-install mode) and `.claude/settings.json` (repo-as-project mode);
  JSON can't carry a comment, so this note + `tests/test_hooks_in_sync.py` are the guard against
  drift. Edit one → edit the other identically. (The standard `hooks/hooks.json` is **auto-loaded**;
  it must *not* be re-declared in `plugin.json` - that double-loads it. See `docs/adr/ADR-002`.)
- **Reviewing code is static by default; executing it is gated.** Running tests, the script, or a
  profiler *executes* the code. `guard-code-execution.py` blocks these unless authorised by the
  `.claude/.exec-consent` marker or the human-set `CST_ALLOW_EXEC=1`. **The marker is human-only**
  (since ADR-002 rec 5 / `guard-consent-writes.py` the model cannot write it - the user creates it;
  always quote the command with the **absolute project path**, e.g.
  `! touch /path/to/project/.claude/.exec-consent`, so a terminal in another directory can't
  create it in the wrong place); the intake "yes" is *intent*, the marker is the *consent*.
  The user is responsible for the safety of code they hand over (CLAUDE.md §7). Threat model:
  `ADR-002`.

## Recurring code-review findings
- **String-matching Bash commands in PreToolUse hooks is advisory only.** Arbitrary shell trivially
  bypasses lexical checks (indirection, subshells, `eval`, `base64|sh`). The real raw-data boundary
  is the `permissions.deny` list in `.claude/settings.json`, `data/raw/` in `.gitignore`, and
  masking-at-source via `scripts/ingest.py`. Any new file-reading tool must be added to the guard
  matcher. (Full bypass enumeration + hardening backlog: `docs/adr/ADR-002`.)
- **Plugin installs don't ship the `permissions.deny` backstop - recreate it.** A plugin can carry
  hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`) but **not** a `permissions.deny` list, so a foreign project that installs
  this plugin gets the raw-data *guard hook* but not the OS-level deny backstop the fail-open paths
  and README lean on. When you install the plugin into a real project, copy the `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`
  `data/raw/**` deny entries from this repo's `.claude/settings.json` into that project's own
  `.claude/settings.json`. (Acknowledged residual: `docs/adr/ADR-002`.)
- **Lexical/regex redaction is best-effort and order-sensitive.** Every new PII pattern needs an
  ordering rationale *and* an overlap test (date vs phone vs account); never rely on it as the sole
  control - free-text comms needs NER (named-entity recognition) before real data. The masking engine is **basic** by design.

## Domain evidence base (general reference, not project memory)
Provenance for the regulatory content the team ships. This is **domain-general** (it applies to any
surveillance engagement), so it lives here; per-engagement findings do not.
- ✅ **AML/TM tuning - VERIFIED**: ATL/BTL, risk-based segmentation, SR 11-7 model validation, FFIEC
  BSA/AML.
- ✅ **FCA Market Watch 79 - VERIFIED**
  (<https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/newsletters/market-watch-79>, May 2024): surveillance
  testing is **four-component** (parameter
  calibration · model logic · model code · **data** comprehensiveness/accuracy), not calibration
  alone; failures often from **data-ingestion gaps**. Drives `/assess-coverage`.
- ✅ **Trade / market-abuse regulatory spine - VERIFIED** (EUR-Lex, legislation.gov.uk, ESMA): MAR
  Art 16(2) STOR obligation; CDR (EU) 2016/957; RTS 24 (CDR 2017/580) order-book records; RTS 22
  (CDR 2017/590) transaction reports; RTS 25 clock-sync. Folded into `trade-scenario-design.md`.
- ✅ **Comms-surveillance regulatory spine - VERIFIED** (ESMA, EUR-Lex, SEC, FINRA, CFTC): MiFID II
  Art 16(7) + CDR (EU) 2017/565 Art 76 (UK SYSC 10A); Exchange Act 17a-4(b)(4) + FINRA 4511(b); WORM
  / Oct-2022 audit-trail alternative; the off-channel sweep. Folded into
  `comms-surveillance-policy.md` + `lexicon-spec.md`.
- 🟢 **PRACTICE CLAIMS VERIFIED (2026-07-06)** - a dedicated pass inventoried 56 falsifiable
  practice claims across the four previously-foundational clusters (comms-surveillance practice;
  coverage-assurance methodology; detection-tuning practice; the DA/BA/role boundary) and checked
  each against primary/authoritative sources. Result: **33 verified · 8 partial · 15
  industry-standard-uncited · 0 unsupported; no claim false or fabricated.** The full verdict
  register with citations is `docs/evidence-base.md`. What that pass establishes:
  - **Verified with a primary source:** the tuning methodology cluster (ATL/BTL, risk-based
    segmentation, statistical thresholds, post-deployment MI, change-management logging) grounds in
    SR 11-7, FFIEC RBA, RTS 25 and vendor methodology; the spoofing/layering typology and signature
    ground in MAR Art 12 and the Coscia/Sarao enforcement records; DQ dimensions and coverage
    independence ground in BCBS 239 and the IIA Three Lines Model; voice-transcription pipelines,
    off-channel controls (SEC/CFTC), worker-monitoring constraints (ICO), and BA scope (BABOK v3 +
    EARS) all have authoritative anchors.
  - **Legitimate practice, keep labelled as such (no single citable source):** several taxonomy and
    enumeration framings (conduct-signal kinds, FP-driver lists, re-tune trigger lists) and the
    **role-boundary RACI** - the independence/segregation *principle* is mandated (SR 11-7, IIA
    Three Lines, FCA SYSC 3.2), but the mapping onto this team's specific named roles is
    operating-model convention, not a regulator mandate.
  - **Corrected this pass:** a lexicon exclusion claim that overstated "no coverage gaps"
    (`lexicon-spec.md`); enforcement-statistics context added to the spoofing defaults
    (`spoofing.md`), which are looser catch-alls than the cases (Coscia ~0.08% fill, <500ms).
  - **Caveat carried forward:** FCA Market Watch 79 is a data/model-governance authority, **not** an
    e-comms-lexicon authority - cite it only for testing/coverage/governance, never for lexicon
    design. Per-file inline-citation threading is a mechanical follow-up (`docs/evidence-base.md`
    §Deferred).
